Nesting: SCSS nesting is employed for more organized and readable styles, particularly within components like navigation menus.

Interpolation: Interpolation is used to generate dynamic CSS properties for elements such as the navigation bar.

Placeholder Selectors: Placeholder selectors are used to define reusable styles and extend them to specific elements.

Mixins: Mixins are implemented to define and reuse style patterns like button styles and apply them where needed.
